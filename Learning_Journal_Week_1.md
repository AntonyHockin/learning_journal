## Learning Activities
This week I revised HTML and CSS in order to prepare myself the rest of this class. This was done through watching the LinkedIn learning videos.

## Estimated Hours
1.5 Hours
## Content Insights
Revised that HTML is used for web content and information, while CSS is used for styling websites differently. Although CSS can be implemented within HMTL, separating the two allows for more efficient coding and better presentation on different devices.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I was initially concerned when I realised I had to relearn HTML and CSS, as it had been some time since I had last used these skills. However, after attempting the learning and doing some practice the knowledge quickly came back to me. Other than that no other insights.
