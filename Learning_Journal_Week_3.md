## Learning Activities
This week I learnt basic Wordpress development. Wordpress is a requirement for this week's practical, as well as for our first assignment. This learning was done through the LinkedIn Learning modules.

## Content Insights
Wordpress websites are created through block based development. Blocks make up the attributes of each site, such as images, paragraphs, lists, quotes and much more. There are also two different types of pages (or articles as they're called in Joomla). Pages in Wordpress are for static content (content that does not change), and are good for creating "About us", "Pricing", "Legal agreements" or other content that is unlikely to change. Posts are the opposite, as they are for dynamic content (which can change overtime). Posts are good for developing blogs and reading articles, and allow for user engagement with the content via comments.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I learnt from my previous mistakes and started the learning earlier. This (perhaps unsurprisingly) allowed me to complete the learning with less stress. I also tried engaging in some learning, and then work on my practical, which did help me retain my skills better. I still feel as I should be doing more learning, and will attempt to put more time aside this coming week for learning.
