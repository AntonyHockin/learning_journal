## Content Insights
Child themes are designed to modify an existing theme. When a child theme modifies an existing theme, that theme is know as the parent theme. Child themes remove an issue related to developing your own theme. Everytime WordPress updates, themes need to be modified to ensure that they can work with the new iteration of WordPress. With child themes, you can have full control of style on a site, while the parent theme allows you to access the latest features on WordPress.

WordPress.org has the official documentation on creating a child theme, so if I'm ever stuff I should check here. Also contains useful information to copy such as the standard style.css header template.

Two conventions for naming child theme folders; either [name of theme]-child or [name of website]. The latter makes it very obvious that this is a child theme unique to the client / organisation.

Developing in the browser allows you to take small, non-permanent steps in designing a webpage. If you make a mistake and want to go back, simply refresh the page, and it will reset to its original form.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In week two I attempted to put my skills to the test first before learning any content. I wanted to try this method again this week with child themes, however I encountered some difficulties. While with the Joomla site I had some idea of where to start, child themes are an entirely new concept to me. There is likely a "golden ratio" of learning and practical development that I should aim to find. Otherwise, no other insights, which may be a sign that I still need to put more time aside to learn.
