PHP allows you to add dynamic and backend functionality to your website. It is often used process forms, talk to a database or reading from a file. PHP is a server-side language, meaning that a remote computer or server handles the processing. This also means that our local computers don't see any PHP code, making it more secure as not everything is exposed in the browser. HTML can exist in PHP files, however the PHP cannot exist in HTML files.

Printing in PHP can be done a few different ways, however the most common is with the echo command. Is command prints exactly what it is given, therefore punctuation or line breaks must be coded by the user. 

PHP is a weakly typed language just like Python. When a variable is declared, it does not need to know the type of variable it is being declared as. Instead, the variable will know based on the information stored within it. E.g. the variable $name = "Antony" knows that it's a string based on what's stored within. Constants are also another type of variable that are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed. They are created using the define function, E.g. define('VERSION', 1.1), VERSION being the name of the constant and 1.1 being the value. Other variable types include Integers (whole numbers), floats (Decimal numbers), Characters (single letters, numbers or symbols), Strings (Collection of characters) and Boolean (True or False).

Boolean operators include ==, ===, >, <, >=, <= and !. Most of these are similar if these are the same to python, if not very similar. === is used the same as == but checks types as well e.g. '1' === 1 returns false.

Logical operators include && (and operator) or || (or operator).

If statements written similarly to java if statements, e.g. if (condition){do this} else{do this instead}.

While / do while loops as well as for loops are available in PHP.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Last week I did not complete the practical, a mix of complacency and leaving other tasks too late. Ever since then I've been struggling to rebuild the motivation or disciple to get back on track. Considering the next assignment is a group project, I do feel responsible to play my part in the team and ensure that I am not dead-weight. A possible insight from this could that I should envision my goals in relations to outside people or factors. I could be more motivated when other people's status is at stake. Another insight could be the opposite approach, that I should strive to take more pride in my own work. Hopefully this method does not result in me being extremely egotistical, however having a bit of a bigger ego regarding my work ethic standards definitely could be beneficial.
