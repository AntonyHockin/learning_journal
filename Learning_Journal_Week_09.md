## Content Insights
Site content should be tailored to your target audience, or the audience that you care the most about. Creating personas of your target audience can help you design with target audience's wants and needs in mind. Each page should show what the site is about, with a clear tagline, and making navigation easy and descriptive.

Design choices to be avoided when creating a site:

* Technical or heavy jargon
* Clickbait or misleading headings on articles
* Large walls of text, these should be split up with dot points, headings, subheadings etc.
* Overly distracting advertising


### _Simple design_
All elements of a website should enhance your content rather than detract from it.

### _Consistent design_
Having the same response whenever people perform an action

### _Standard design_
Use design elements the same way that major sites do

Start the design process by considering your content or what you will display on site. Then iterate both your content and your design until your confident you've found the best way to get your information across to your visitors.

The first paragraph of articles should summarize the page's content, this way users will know what the page is about straight away. Headings should be used to convey meaningful information within articles.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After last weeks experiment, I have continued to work outside my room to further help with limiting my distractions. This tactic has worked to a varying degree, as sometimes I still find myself daydreaming or purposefully doing something else in order to procrastinate. At the time of writing I am also recovering from covid, so I expect my overall cognition and train of thought worse than usually. Although my room is not soundproof, working outside it means that I am exposed to other sounds that I usually would not hear. From idle chatter in my home, to neighbourhood dogs barking, everything outside my room is much louder and more distracting. I've wanted a pair of noise-cancelling headphones for a while for multiple reasons, however purchasing a pair for study purposes could be a valuable investment.
