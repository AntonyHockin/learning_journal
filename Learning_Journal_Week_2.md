## Week 2

## Learning Activities
This week I learnt Joomla, in order to develop a basic website and to gain some starting experience with content management systems. This was done through a youtube tutorial.

## Content Insights
Joomla (and other CMS) allow for web development without the need to write raw HMTL or CSS. Pages are created through articles and grouped into categories. Website features such as headers, banners, search bars and breadcrumbs are created and managed through site modules. Styling is done through templates, such as the default Cassiopea template, though additional styling can be done with CSS.  
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Before attempting any learning, I tried to create a Joomla website by myself. This attempt was unsuccessful and put me off trying again for sometime. After watching the video I felt much more confident in my understanding of Joomla. In the future I will remember that all skills have a learning curve, and if I feel stuck I should go learn more. Although I am satisfied with the result of my Joomla site, I still feel like there is more to learn. To remedy this, I should start my learning earlier next week.
