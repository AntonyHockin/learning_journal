## Content Insights
Themes should be developed with a Modular Mobile-First Design. This means three things:
* Content should be designed within modules that fit together to create the whole view of a page. This creates a more dynamic environment.
* Everything should be developed for smaller screens first, specifically a vertical smartphone. Responsive design principles should be applied to make the same content look good on other screens.
* As much of the design should be done in the browser as possible

This course also teaches you some basic Sass, which is used to create CSS with some dynamic properties like variables and functions. I will more than likely be learning more about Sass next week, but the basic foundations that this course shows is a helpful introduction.

The workflow outlined in this course is a useful guide to keep in mind when creating a theme, starting with the font, then creating a responsive typography and layout. The next steps involve designing a header and footer and eventually continue to creating layouts for posts and pages. It might be beneficial to propose this workflow to my assignment group, as this course makes development relatively easy.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Last week I mentioned that I was struggling to find motivation to complete these practicals and proposed some strategies to help me get back on track. Learning for the sake of my team has given me motivation to work harder, but I fear that this motivation will have diminishing returns. I have to discipline myself so that I do my learning whether I want to do it or not. From experience with building other habits, I should try to do a little everyday and set myself up for success when doing my learning. This means minimal distractions and starting this learning as early in the day as possible. By starting early I can get it out of the way and ensure that I won't procrastinate doing the learning any later in the day. I think this will be something I test in the upcoming practical.
